SINGLE-TRIALS MINING WITH GABRIEL GRAPH FOR ACCURATE DETECTION OF AMPLITUDE-LATENCY IN ERPS and EPs


I demonstrate a novel technique of mining single-trialsin EPs and ERPs studies based on Gabriel Graph and Network Analysiswith main scope
to increase the SNR of the grand-averaged and also for the accurate detection of amplitude-latency.
Soon, i will release the MATLAB code and the draft describing the whole approach.
